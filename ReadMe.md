## Book Recommendation System

This book  relies on scikit-learn's Truncated Singular Value decomposition to create colloaborative filtering based book recommendations. Please see main.ipynb for data preprocessing and model evaluations.

To run the streamlit demo follow these steps:
    <ol>
    <li>Create a new conda enviornment</li>
    <li> Install the requirements from requirements.txt </li>
    <li> Activate the conda enivornment </li>
    <li> Run `streamlit run app.py` in the terminal </li>
    </ol>
This will launch the streamlit app on http://localhost:8501
where users can enter their favorite books and genres to receive personalized book recommendations.
