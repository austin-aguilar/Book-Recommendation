## Book Recommendation System

This book  relies on scikit-learn's Truncated Singular Value decomposition to create colloaborative filtering based book recommendations. Please see main.ipynb for data preprocessing and model evaluations.

To run the streamlit demo follow these steps:
    1. Create a new conda enviornment
    2. Install the requirements from requirements.txt
    3. Activate the conda enivornment
    4. Run `streamlit run app.py` in the terminal

This will launch the streamlit app on http://localhost:8501
where users can enter their favorite books and genres to receive personalized book recommendations.
